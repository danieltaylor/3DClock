# 3DClock
This is a clock based on the GIF found [here](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/631719408935804928), and created by [@muratpak](https://twitter.com/muratpak).   It is mostly a proof of concept for what I hope to make of it in the future, so there are still flaws.

####Future Plans
I'm hoping to convert this to an HTML lockscreen for iOS, [per this request](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3khtjc/request_saw_this_gif_over_in_rwoahdude_could_it/).
Additionally, [@pcdevil](https://twitter.com/pcdevil) [recreated the GIF in CSS](https://codepen.io/pcdevil/pen/doxYXW).  If possible, I would like to make use of this code to give the clock a much cleaner display.
